# 1. Infinite Scroll Challenge
This project is meant to show an infinite scrolling method; such that of pinterest and tumblr - when a user reaches the bottom of the page, more data is loaded and rendered.

## Description
Infinite scrolling can be used to render data as the user scrolls, giving the user an "Infinite scrolling" feel due to data loading as soon as the bottom of the page is reached. This can be used to render lots of the same types of data - as a replacement for pages. This is meant to mimic Pinterest. Site is fully responsive and pin comments can be toggled by clicking the comments link.

## Instructions
To run, clone repo and run npm install in the directory. Then running npm start or the start script indicated in package.json will have the project running in localhost.

## Dependencies
For this project the only dependency used was Axios, as a replacement for fetch.

## Issues
Changing anything - styling/rendering may cause posts to be rendered several times after saving file. Refreshing page should fix it.

## Acknowledgements
Pinterest, for the icons, styling, and sample data.
